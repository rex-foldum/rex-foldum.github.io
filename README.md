### What is rex-foldum.github.io ?

GitHub hosts pages for user accounts and organizations at github.io:  
https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-github-pages

So the index.html for this repository defines the GitHub Page for this account!

### What are you doing with your GitHub Page?

Currently, I am only using it for a project that anyone &mdash; anyone who is comfortable with HTML and understands the basics of CSS and JS &mdash; can try out at:  
https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884

In a nutshell, you learn some important page speed optimizations Google recommends for developers at...  
https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance

...and then you apply what you've learned to improve the project hosted at:  
https://github.com/cameronwp/udportfolio

### Anything we should know about said project?

Well, I've finished it; my optimizations are done.

I logged all the changes as I made them through the issues interface:  
https://github.com/rex-foldum/rex-foldum.github.io/issues/1
